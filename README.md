This is a copy of the ``cuda-convnet`` convolutional neural network
implementation written by Alex Krizhevsky.

``cuda-convnet`` has quite extensive documentation itself.  Find the
`MAIN DOCUMENTATION HERE <http://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet/>`_.

===================
Additional features
===================

This document will have several reading notes of mine for
``cuda-convnet`` as hosted on Google Code and this version.

Updated to work with CUDA 5.5
=============================

The build configuration and code has been updated to work with CUDA
5.5.  The paths in ``build.sh`` and ``Makefile`` were updated to work
with the default install directories of the `CUDA Toolkit 5.5
<https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`_.
